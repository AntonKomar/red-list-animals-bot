# red-list-animals-bot

The bot identifies animalâ€™s species by photo and defines if it is an endangered kind or not.

The model uses tensorflow and keras for animals prediction.

Also the project requires to install Bottle with ```pip install bottle``` or download the source package at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bottle/).

To test this bot you can host it locally by using ngrok. It allows to expose a web server running on the local machine to the internet. You simply need to tell ngrok what port the web server is listening on.

Afterwards you can set a webhook  to test the bot in the telegram provided by ngrok in the telegram server by running this URL: https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebHook?url=https://xxxxxxxxx.ngrok.io
